# CS210-Project-3

In this project, I utilized C++ and Python to create a program that could read information from a text file and perform several tasks on user input. C++ was used to create the user interface and passes responses to Python. Python processes the data from the file (in resources folder) and sends the count of the user's chosen item to C++. I believe the Python code is done very efficiently and minimizes ram usage of the program. I think the C++ function that translates to Python could be more efficient. Currently there are 2 different pass functions, but I believe 1 could be used. The most difficult part of the code was getting the pass function working. I used 2 different functions to overcome the block. Understanding coding in multiple languages will be very helpful in future classes. To make the program more readable, I made sure to use proper spacing and clear comments that did not make the code overly messy. It should be easy to adapt because I broke up the code into functions that are called from main, so the main method can have more calls added to new functions.
